## Example Usecase of `RecommenderModel` and `DatabaseConnection` modules

### Import necessary modules

```
import pandas as pd
from dbcon import DatabaseConnection
from recommender import RecommenderModel
```

### Initialize FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

### Connection URI and MongoDB collection names

```
# replace `<password>` in the uri with actual one

uri = "mongodb+srv://e19163:<password>@cluster45204.sxzufw7.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
db_name = "bid_circle"
ratings_collection_name = "ratings"
recommendations_collection_name = "recommendations"
```

### Database connection instances for 2 collections

```
db_connection_ratings = DatabaseConnection(uri, db_name, ratings_collection_name)
db_connection_recommendations = DatabaseConnection(uri, db_name, recommendations_collection_name)
```

### Example rating comming from the frontend

```
user_id = '0x01'
auction_id = '0001'
rating = '2'
```

### Save ratings to MongoDB

```
db_connection_ratings.connect()
db_connection_ratings.save_rating(user_id, auction_id, rating)
db_connection_ratings.close()
```

### To delete a rating if needed

```
db_connection_ratings.connect()
db_connection_ratings.delete_rating(user_id, auction_id)
db_connection_ratings.close()
```

### Fetch ratings from MongoDB

```
db_connection_ratings.connect()
movies_list = db_connection_ratings.fetch_ratings()
db_connection_ratings.close()
```

### Convert ratings data to DataFrame

```
movies_df = pd.DataFrame(movies_list)
data_df = movies_df.drop('_id', axis=1)
```

### Initialize recommender model

```
recommenderModel = RecommenderModel(data_df)
```

### Generate recommendations

```
recommendations = recommenderModel.recommend()
```

### Save recommendations to MongoDB

```
db_connection_recommendations.connect()
db_connection_recommendations.clear_recommendations()  # Clear previous recommendations
db_connection_recommendations.save_recommendations(recommendations)
db_connection_recommendations.close()
```

### fetch recommendations from MongoDB

```
db_connection_recommendations.connect()
recommendations = db_connection_recommendations.fetch_recommendations(user_id)
db_connection_recommendations.close()
```

### print the recommendations

```
print(recommendations)
```

### Run `main.py`

```
# to test the database connections and the recommender module run
python .\main.py
```

### Final output of above configuration should look like this

```
