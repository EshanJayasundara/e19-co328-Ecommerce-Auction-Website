### Collaborative Filtering Approach

The collaborative filtering approach in this example involves several steps to predict user ratings and generate recommendations. Here's a detailed explanation of the operations performed on the initial table, the utility matrix, and the final prediction.

### Initial Table

The initial table provided contains user ratings for various auctions:

```
user_id,auction_id,rating
0x04,0005,5
0x02,0001,4
0x03,0005,4
0x05,0004,5
0x05,0002,3
0x02,0004,3
0x04,0002,3
0x04,0004,4
0x03,0003,3
0x03,0004,5
0x01,0002,2
0x05,0001,1
0x01,0003,4
```

### Step-by-Step Operations

1. **Pivot the Initial Table to Create the Utility Matrix:**

   The initial table is transformed into a utility matrix where rows represent users, columns represent auctions, and the values are the ratings given by users to auctions. Missing values (i.e., auctions not rated by a user) are filled with `NaN`.

   ```
   auction_id  0001  0002  0003  0004  0005
   user_id
   0x01        NaN   2.0   4.0   NaN   NaN
   0x02        4.0   NaN   NaN   3.0   NaN
   0x03        NaN   NaN   3.0   5.0   4.0
   0x04        NaN   3.0   NaN   4.0   5.0
   0x05        1.0   3.0   NaN   5.0   NaN
   ```

2. **Fill NaN Values in the Utility Matrix:**

   NaN values in the utility matrix are filled with 0 to create a complete matrix where all interactions are represented (even if a user did not rate an auction).

   ```
   auction_id  0001  0002  0003  0004  0005
   user_id
   0x01        0.0   2.0   4.0   0.0   0.0
   0x02        4.0   0.0   0.0   3.0   0.0
   0x03        0.0   0.0   3.0   5.0   4.0
   0x04        0.0   3.0   0.0   4.0   5.0
   0x05        1.0   3.0   0.0   5.0   0.0
   ```

3. **Calculate Mean Ratings for Each Auction:**

   The mean rating for each auction is calculated and stored. This helps in mean-centering the ratings.

   ```
   auction_id
   0001    1.0
   0002    1.6
   0003    1.4
   0004    2.4
   0005    1.8
   dtype: float64
   ```

4. **Create Mean-Centered Utility Matrix:**

   The mean rating for each auction is subtracted from the corresponding auction ratings to center the ratings around the mean. NaN values are filled with 0.

   ```
   auction_id  0001  0002  0003  0004  0005
   user_id
   0x01       -1.0   0.4   2.6  -2.4  -1.8
   0x02        3.0  -1.6  -1.4   0.6  -1.8
   0x03       -1.0  -1.6   1.6   2.6   2.2
   0x04       -1.0   1.4  -1.4   1.6   3.2
   0x05        0.0   1.4  -1.4   2.6  -1.8
   ```

5. **Find Neighbors Using Cosine Similarity:**

   The cosine similarity between the target user and all other users is calculated to find the closest neighbors. For example, for user `0x01`, the cosine similarity with all other users is computed.

6. **Calculate Baseline Prediction:**

   For each auction, the baseline prediction is calculated using the global mean, user bias, and item bias.

   ```
   Baseline_ui = global_mean + user_bias + item_bias
   ```

7. **Predict Item Rating:**

   The rating for a specific user and auction is predicted by considering the ratings of the user's neighbors and their similarities, adjusted by the baseline prediction.

   ```
   user_item_predicted_rating = baseline + (sum(similarity * adjusted_rating) / sum(similarity))
   ```

8. **Generate Recommendations:**

   For a given user, ratings for all unseen auctions are predicted and sorted in descending order to recommend the top items.

   ```
   recommendation_df = prediction_df.sort_values('predicted_ratings', ascending=False)
   ```

### Example of Generating Recommendations for User `0x01`

1. **Find Neighbors for User `0x01`:**

   Compute the cosine similarity between `0x01` and all other users, then select the closest neighbors.

2. **Predict Ratings for Unseen Auctions:**

   Predict the ratings for auctions not rated by `0x01` using the ratings of the closest neighbors and their similarities.

3. **Sort and Recommend:**

   Sort the predicted ratings in descending order and recommend the top items to `0x01`.

This collaborative filtering approach leverages user-user similarity and baseline predictions to provide personalized auction recommendations.
